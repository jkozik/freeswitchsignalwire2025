# Freeswitch docker container linked to Signalwire 2025
I went to [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/) and [searched for freeswitch](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=freeswitch).  I was looking for the office docker image.  I found dozens of them.  Unsure of which one to pick, I decided to base this project on [`safarov/freeswitch`](https://hub.docker.com/r/safarov/freeswitch).  It has over 1M downloads, and was only 2 months old.  Someday, I'll learn the official docker image release process.

What I wanted to do was run a freeswitch container on my home LAN and connect it to Signalwire.  I wanted to a setup that was a push button as possible.
